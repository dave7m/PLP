This is my personal repository for the seminar programming languages and paradigms in the spring semester 2022.

In the first assignment, a simple Hello World program is written. 
Furthermore, I wrote a Converter, which takes input from the user, and converts that input to the corresponding date in the International Fixed Calendar.

For compiling the code, just open the directory in your terminal, and type ```go build .```. For getting the depedencies, type ```go get .```.
For compiling and directly running the code, type ```go run .```. For running the tests, type ```go test```. 

For Assignments 2 and 3, see the readmes in those folders.
